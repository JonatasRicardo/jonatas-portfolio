The year was **2017**.  
On my way to work, sitting in the subway, I had a thought:  
> “What if I finally brought that idea to life?”  

The idea? **Funny T-shirts for developers.**  
I called it **IT-shirts** (or “TI-shirts” in Portuguese).

After **five years** working on major e-commerce projects like **Calvin Klein, Havaianas, and Walmart**, I knew how complex running an online store could be.  
So, I decided to do something unusual: **launch a store inside my GitHub `README.md`**.

I designed the prints, added payment links for each one, and handled customer support through email.  
Simple, fast, and it worked.

## Early Return

Even if I had chosen a ready-made e-commerce template, I know I would have spent countless hours customizing it — because… well, that’s the fun part.

But by choosing the simplest path possible, I was able to **test fast, get real feedback, and focus on what really mattered**.  
That was my **early return** — validating the idea before overinvesting in features or infrastructure.

## Overcoming Fear & Learning New Things

Every technology we use today came from someone asking themselves:  
> “What if…?”

What if I launched a product?  
What if I learned a new technology?  
What if I sent that LinkedIn message?  

In my case, my “What if” moment was **showing my project at a dev event**.  
There, I could see people’s genuine reactions: laughing at the shirts, asking questions, sharing feedback — and I learned more in that one day than in months of coding.

## Training My Mental Model

Stepping out of your comfort zone stretches you — not only as a professional but as a person.  
Even when things don’t work out, you grow.  

Looking back, I can clearly see how that experiment shaped my mindset.  
It was a chain of small “What ifs” that changed my career trajectory:

- **Sep/2017:** left a comfortable technical leadership role after 5 stable years.  
- **Nov/2017:** launched the “funny dev T-shirt” project ❤️  
- **2018:** switched from frontend to fullstack — in a company that *builds submarines* (really).  
- **2020:** launched an online e-commerce course for developers (VTEX).  
- **2022:** started working for U.S. companies.  
- **2025:** specialized at the **MIT** in **AI & Machine Learning**, expanding my horizons.

## So… what happened to the store?

In the end, the business itself didn’t succeed.  
But **what if I hadn’t tried?**

I probably wouldn’t have had the courage to take many of the next steps in my journey.  

The store taught me lessons about **product thinking**, **marketing**, **fast validation**, and the importance of testing ideas early.  
And honestly — it was a great excuse to reconnect with friends at that developer event.
